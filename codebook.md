# Code book
This code book describes all the variables in the `avgdata.txt` file after running the `RunAnalysis.R` script.

# Variables 
->  `subject`  - This is an integer datatype. With 30 different sets recorded

->  `activity` - This is a string datatype. And this describes the activity that they were performing while the measurements were being                    recorded
               1. LAYING
               2. SITTING
               3. STANDING
               4. WALKING
               5. WALKING DOWNSTAIRS
               6. WALKING UPSTAIRS
               
               


# Measurements
These variables are the mean values for the measurements based on the subject and the activity.
